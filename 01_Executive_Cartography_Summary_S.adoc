This document is a synthesis addressing one of the 8 critical _Technologies_ identified for the development of the ((eHorizon)) Project, namely the *Advanced Cartography Technology*, required, for example, for autonomous driving.

The objective of this document is to make a test of the github editor (ascii doc format ?):

	* Specifications for algorithm portability
	* Requirements for the embedded platform
	* Specifications for a 3D High Definition cartography
	* Requirements for the Back End platform
	* Specifications for the Advanced 3D Cartography
